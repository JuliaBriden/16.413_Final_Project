# Precision Landing Maneuver:
# Upon receiving an initial surface-relative position and velocity estimate from the ILS, guidance
# will perform the Precision Landing Maneuver (PLM). The objective of this maneuver is to steer
# the PDV so that, at the end of the maneuver, the PDV is vertically-oriented directly above the
# landing site at an altitude of 1000 m with zero horizontal velocity and vertical velocity of -30 m/s.
# When the PLM is complete, the PDV will descend to an altitude of 500 m to begin Hazard
# Detection and Avoidance.

# Hazard Detection and Avoidance:
# When the PDV is at an altitude of 500 m and directly above the targeted landing location, it uses
# the 3D-imaging lidar to scan the landing site, construct a safe landing map, and select a landing 
# Pre-decisional: for information and discussion only 13
# location within that map. This activity must complete in three seconds, at which time the PDV will
# be approximately 400 m above the targeted landing location.
# Once the Hazard Detection activity has finished, guidance uses the new, safe landing location
# to construct a guidance profile and steer the vehicle to a point above the targeted safe landing spot.
# The Hazard Avoidance Maneuver begins at an altitude of 250 m and completes at an altitude of
# 30 m with a vertical velocity of -0.5 m/s. The safe landing map, using the data from the 3D-imaging
# lidar, will be 100 m ï‚´ 100 m and the vehicle has the capability to land anywhere within that map.
