    "\n",
    "The year is 2048 and alien life has been detected under the ice of Europa! In the interest of getting to know our newly discovered neighbors, NASA has decided to dispatch a highly specialized fleet of vehicles to the Gallilean moon. The mission will consist of (i) an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) designed to slowly glide to Europa's sea floor while transmitting data via an optical fiber cable to a rover on the surface, (ii) a surface rover designed to ferry the underwater vehicle from a safe landing site to an appropriate insertion site (i.e. vapor plume outburst location), and (iii) an orbiter, capable of relaying signals from the rover and providing high-resolution imagery to map the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](environment_basic.jpg \"Europa Lander mission concept\")\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, our team has been tasked with creating the trajectory generation algorithm for the surface vehicle. The goal for the rover is to navigate from a safe landing site which is flat and free of obstacles to the AUV's insertion point, which has relatively thin ice and may be surrounded by uncertain hazards. We have access to global map data within the field of operation, allowing us to formulate the trajectory generation problem as an infinite horizon mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. We will solve this optimization problem using scipy.minimize and the Bernstein polynomial library BEBOT. To provide additional autonomy capabilities and give the optimization algorithm a good chance of finding a feasible solution, we will initilize the optimizer using RRT* to form an initial guess of the optimal trajectory.\n",

However, it requires an initial guess of the optimal trajectory as a starting point from which to begin using gradient descent. This guess warrants some consideration as it can have a large influence on the output of the function: one initial guess may give a good answer, while another may give local minima or even fail to converge to a solution. One option to generate this initial guess is to linearly interpolate between the initial and final positions. However it is often beneficial to give an initial guess which satisfies the system's constraints, which may not be the case if an obstacle lies on the straightline path between the initial and final positions. Thus, we plan to use RRT* as a fast way to generate what is hopefully a good initial guess.\n",
